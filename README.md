# 0G Tapp

0G Tapp is a Trusted Application Platform that provides secure application deployment and execution within Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). It enables confidential computing with runtime measurement and attestation capabilities.

## Features

- **TEE-based Execution**: Run applications in secure enclaves (TDX, SEV, SGX)
- **Runtime Measurement**: Cryptographic measurement of application deployments
- **Remote Attestation**: Generate and verify attestation evidence
- **Docker Compose Integration**: Deploy containerized applications easily
- **gRPC API**: Comprehensive API for application lifecycle management
- **Signature-based Authentication**: EVM-compatible signature verification for access control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Alibaba Cloud account (for confidential computing instances)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- grpcurl (for testing)
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)

### Creating a Confidential Computing Instance

To run 0G Tapp, you need to create an Alibaba Cloud ECS instance with confidential computing support.

#### Step 1: Import the Confidential Image

1. Navigate to [Alibaba Cloud Custom Image Import](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/ecs/user-guide/import-a-custom-image#a79650c1bdp04)

2. Import the confidential image with the following parameters:
   - **Image File URL**: `https://confidential-disk.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/0g-tapp-confidential-gpu.qcow2`
   - **Operating System Type**: Linux
   - **Operating System Version**: Aliyun
   - **Architecture**: 64-bit Operating System
   - **Boot Mode**: UEFI
   - **Image Format**: QCOW2

#### Step 2: Configure NVMe Driver Support

After the image import completes:
1. Go to the image details page
2. Change **NVMe Driver** setting to **Supported**

#### Step 3: Create ECS Instance

Create a new ECS instance with the following specifications:
- **Region**: China (Beijing) - Zone L
- **Instance Type**: `ecs.gn8v-tee.4xlarge`
- **Image**: Select the imported confidential image

Once the instance is created and running, 0G Tapp service will start automatically.

### Deploying Applications on 0G Tapp

#### Starting an Application

Use the provided example script to deploy an application:

```bash
./start_app.sh --host HOST --port PORT --app-id APP_ID [OPTIONS]

# Example with owner credentials
export TAPP_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
./start_app.sh --host your-cvm-instance-host --port 50051 --app-id my-nginx-app --use-owner

# Example with custom private key
./start_app.sh --host localhost --port 50051 --app-id my-app --private-key 0xabcd1234...
```

**Options:**
- `--host HOST`: gRPC server host (default: localhost)
- `--port PORT`: gRPC server port (default: 50051)
- `--app-id APP_ID`: Application ID (default: test-broker-app)
- `--private-key KEY`: Private key for signing (required unless using presets)
- `--compose-file FILE`: Docker compose file (default: examples/docker-compose.yml)
- `--use-owner`: Use pre-configured owner credentials (requires TAPP_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY env var)
- `--use-whitelist`: Use pre-configured whitelist user credentials (requires TAPP_WHITELIST_PRIVATE_KEY env var)

**What happens:**
1. The script submits a StartApp request with Docker Compose configuration
2. Files referenced in volume mounts (e.g., `./config.yml:/app/config.yml`) are automatically uploaded
3. Returns a task ID for tracking deployment progress
4. The application deployment is cryptographically measured and extended to TEE runtime measurements

**Note:** RootFS space is limited, store data in the `/data` directory.

#### Stopping an Application

Stop and remove a deployed application:

```bash
./stop_app.sh --host HOST --port PORT --app-id APP_ID [OPTIONS]

# Example with owner credentials
export TAPP_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
./stop_app.sh --host your-cvm-instance-host --port 50051 --app-id my-nginx-app --use-owner

# Example with custom private key
./stop_app.sh --host localhost --port 50051 --app-id my-app --private-key 0xabcd1234...
```

**Options:**
- `--host HOST`: gRPC server host (default: localhost)
- `--port PORT`: gRPC server port (default: 50051)
- `--app-id APP_ID`: Application ID to stop (required)
- `--private-key KEY`: Private key for signing (required unless using presets)
- `--use-owner`: Use pre-configured owner credentials
- `--use-whitelist`: Use pre-configured whitelist user credentials

## Security

### Security Model: Malicious Deployer Protection

0G Tapp implements a **"Malicious Deployer" security model**, which provides the strongest security guarantees in the TEE application platform space. Under this model:

- **Even the deployer cannot compromise the application**
- **Deployers can only interact with the TDX instance through restricted gRPC interfaces** - they cannot arbitrarily access the TDX instance
- Applications run in isolated TEE environments with cryptographic integrity
- Runtime measurements ensure that deployed code matches what was intended
- Private keys are bound to specific application measurements and cannot be extracted
- TEE hardware protections prevent unauthorized access to application memory and secrets

This means that once an application is deployed and measured:
1. The deployer cannot access application secrets or private keys
2. The deployer cannot modify the running application without detection
3. All application state and data remain confidential within the TEE
4. Remote attestation allows third parties to verify application integrity

This security model is ideal for scenarios requiring maximum trust minimization, such as:
- Multi-party computation platforms
- Decentralized oracle networks
- Privacy-preserving data processing
- Trustless application execution

### Trusted Execution Environment

All applications run within TEE boundaries and are cryptographically measured. The runtime measurements are extended to the TEE event log for remote attestation.

### Measurement Design Philosophy

0G Tapp implements a carefully designed measurement strategy that balances security auditability with operational efficiency:

#### What Gets Measured

**✅ Operations that execute within the TEE:**
- **Successful operations**: Application deployments, configuration changes, and lifecycle operations that complete successfully
- **Failed operations**: Operations that were permitted but failed during execution (e.g., Docker deployment failures, resource constraints)

All measurements include:
- Operation type (start_app, stop_app, etc.)
- Application configuration hashes (Docker Compose, mount files)
- Deployer identity (EVM address)
- Execution result (success/failed) and error details
- Timestamp

**❌ What is NOT measured:**

- **Permission check failures**: Operations blocked by authentication or authorization layers
- **Pre-execution validation failures**: Requests rejected before entering the TEE execution context

#### Rationale

The key principle is: **Measure what the TEE cannot judge, but must record for accountability.**

**Why measure successful operations:**
- Creates an immutable audit trail of all applications deployed in the TEE
- Enables remote parties to verify exactly what code is running
- Binds cryptographic identities to specific deployments

**Why measure failed operations:**
- Failed operations represent actual execution attempts that consumed TEE resources
- Repeated failures may indicate attack probing or system misconfiguration
- Provides complete forensic history for security analysis
- Users should be accountable for what they attempted, not just what succeeded

**Why NOT measure permission denials:**
- These are policy enforcement actions that happen before TEE execution
- TAPP can definitively determine authorization - no ambiguity exists
- Recording every rejected request would create noise without security value
- The TEE didn't execute anything, so there's nothing to audit from a runtime perspective

**Example:**
- ❌ User tries to deploy without proper authentication → **Rejected, not measured** (TAPP policy enforcement)
- ✅ User deploys a Docker container that fails to start → **Measured as failure** (TEE executed, outcome uncertain)
- ✅ User deploys a malicious container that runs successfully → **Measured as success** (TEE cannot judge intent, only record what happened)

This design ensures that TEE measurements provide a complete, tamper-proof record of all operations that actually executed within the trusted environment, while avoiding unnecessary overhead from policy enforcement actions.
